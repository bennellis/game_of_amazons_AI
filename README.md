This project was created for UBC course COSC322 (introduction to AI)

The project was to create a game playing AI for the two player computer game 
"Game of Amazons".

Utilizes an alpha-beta minimax algorithm, iterative deepening, and five different 
heuristic functions to evaluate and make strategic decisions in indeterminate 
game states.
